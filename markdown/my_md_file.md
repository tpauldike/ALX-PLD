# Practicing Writing in Markdown Language 
This is me trying to master the act of writing some Markdown document and it is
quite an interesting thing to do, as I have found out that I will be needing it
as a full stack __Software Engineer__, especially to present my README files on
Github.

_Training under **ALX** has been awesome and (of course) overwhelming_. They expect
us to figure out most things on our own and it's really not easy but the result
makes me appreciate it. Learning to write *a good README file* is one of the
things that I eventually had to teach myself

### Let's Do Some More
So far, I have implemented header 1, paragragh, header 3, bold, italics and the
next will be some multiple paragraph **blockquotes** as follows:

> Isn't this so interesting?
>
> I couldn't do this a while ago
>
> And I had to write with no way to see the ouput except I push to git
>
>> And now some **nested blockqoutes** follows
>>
>> - I made some list here
>> - With some bulletin


I played with ordered, unordered and nested lists, and I got this:
1. My siblings are:
   1. EbubeDike
   2. Godleads
   3. Blessing
   4. Chichezuom
2. My mates in ALX SE Cohort 7 include:
   + Ebube Anyanwu
   + Dr. Obed Ehoneah
   + Tony Eseh
   + John Ofem
3. About me a bit
   - Best Colours
     - White
     - Gold
     - Black
   - Best Foods
     *I have no particular best food, my best foods are:*
     - Nutritious
     - Hygienic
     - Tasty

The most interesting part is how that I had to push this to git first before
I could see whether or not my syntax were correct. Look at Best Foods again
and observe that I added an element between the list and the list still
continued.

Can I try rendering some text as codes? Let me try. A variadic function in
C looks like this
  return_data_type function_name(parameter(s), <eclipse>)

Let me try writing a variadic function in C that adds all the integers entered
```
    int sum_all(const int n, ...)
    {
	va_list numbers; /*declaration of variables*/
	int i, sum = 0;

	if (n == 0)
	   return (0);

	numbers = va_start(numbers, n) /*initialization*/
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		sum += va_arg(numbers, int);
	}
	va_end(numbers);
	return (sum);
    }
```

The function prototype for the code above is `int sum_all(const int, ...);`

I will write a better one as I make progress; I have seen certain README
files that made me think that they were written with some word processing
app, now that I know that it is just syntax, I will learn them practically
