# Practicing Writing in Markdown Language 
This is me trying to master the act of writing some Markdown document and it is
quite an interesting thing to do, as I have found out that I will be needing it
as a full stack __Software Engineer__, especially to present my README files on
Github.

_Training under **ALX** has been awesome and (of course) overwhelming_. They expect
us to figure out most things on our own and it's really not easy but the result
makes me appreciate it. Learning to write *a good README file* is one of the
things that I eventually had to teach myself

### Let's Do Some More
So far, I have implemented header 1, paragragh, header 3, bold, italics and the
next will be some multiple paragraph **blockquotes** as follows:

> Isn't this so interesting?
>
> I couldn't do this a while ago
>
> And I had to write with no way to see the ouput except I push to git
>
>> And now some **nested blockqoutes** follows
>>
>> - I made some list here
>> - With some bulletin


If I wanted my list ordered and nested, it will look like this:
1. My siblings are:
   +  bubeDike
   + Godleads
   + Blessing
   + Chichezuom
2. My mates in ALX SE Cohort 7 include:
   + Ebube Anyanwu
   + Dr. Obed Ehoneah
   + Tony Eseh
   + John Ofem
3. About me a bit
   - Best Colours
     - White
     - Gold
     - Black
   - Best Foods
     - Something nutritious
     - Something hygienic
     - Something tasty

And I could go on and on
